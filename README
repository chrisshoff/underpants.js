The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic node.js server that can be extended indefinitely by users. At its creation, its only available feature should be to add more features.

For now, it's only a quick skeleton with some sample features.

Requires mongodb to be installed - can be installed via your package manager or from http://www.mongodb.org

Also requires the mongodb native node.js driver - can be installed with npm using "npm install mongodb" or cloned from https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native

These dependencies may be added to the project at some point. Live with it for now.

Run with:

node app.js
